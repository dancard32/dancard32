# Hi, I'm Dan Card👋

### About me
I am an aspiring software engineer. I obtained my educational background in aerospace engineering, but am eagerly looking to transition into the world of technology and programming!

My current interest in software is Python development, both front-end and back-end. Through my graduate studies focusing of space propulsion, I found my passion of programming. After much reflection, I've decided that I would like to pursue this career.

I can be reached via my email at dcard@umich.edu
