# Hi, I'm Dan Card👋

### About me
I am an aspiring software engineer. Formerly I am an aerospace engineer, but am eagerly looking to transition into the world of technology!

My current interest in software is Python development, both front-end and back-end. Through my graduate studies focusing on in-space propulsion, I found my passion of programming. After much reflection, I've decided that I would like to pursue software.

I can be reached via my email at dcard@umich.edu

* 📝 I'm learning about front-end development with React
* 🧐 I am looking to help with an open-source project
* ⚡️ Fun-Fact: I have hiked 9 mountains 🏔
* 🙌🏽 Goal of 2022: Transition into software engineering
