Hi, I'm Dan Card, I am an aspiring software engineer.
I am an aerospace engineer in training, but am eagerly looking to transition into the world of technology!

My current interests in software is Python development, both front-end and back-end.
Through my graduate studies focusing in space propulsion, I found my passion of programming.
After much reflection, I've decided that I would like to pursue software.

I can be reached via my email at dcard@umich.edu
